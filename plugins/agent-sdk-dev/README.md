# Agent SDK Development Plugin

A comprehensive plugin for creating and verifying Claude Agent SDK applications in Python and TypeScript.

## Overview

The Agent SDK Development Plugin streamlines the entire lifecycle of building Agent SDK applications, from initial scaffolding to verification against best practices. It helps you quickly start new projects with the latest SDK versions and ensures your applications follow official documentation patterns.

## Features

### Command: `/new-sdk-app`

Interactive command that guides you through creating a new Claude Agent SDK application.

**What it does:**
- Asks clarifying questions about your project (language, name, agent type, starting point)
- Checks for and installs the latest SDK version
- Creates all necessary project files and configuration
- Sets up proper environment files (.env.example, .gitignore)
- Provides a working example tailored to your use case
- Runs type checking (TypeScript) or syntax validation (Python)
- Automatically verifies the setup using the appropriate verifier agent

**Usage:**
```bash
/new-sdk-app my-project-name
```

Or simply:
```bash
/new-sdk-app
```

The command will interactively ask you:
1. Language choice (TypeScript or Python)
2. Project name (if not provided)
3. Agent type (coding, business, custom)
4. Starting point (minimal, basic, or specific example)
5. Tooling preferences (npm/yarn/pnpm or pip/poetry)

**Example:**
```bash
/new-sdk-app customer-support-agent
# → Creates a new Agent SDK project for a customer support agent
# → Sets up TypeScript or Python environment
# → Installs latest SDK version
# → Verifies the setup automatically
```

### Agent: `agent-sdk-verifier-py`

Thoroughly verifies Python Agent SDK applications for correct setup and best practices.

**Verification checks:**
- SDK installation and version
- Python environment setup (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml)
- Correct SDK usage and patterns
- Agent initialization and configuration
- Environment and security (.env, API keys)
- Error handling and functionality
- Documentation completeness

**When to use:**
- After creating a new Python SDK project
- After modifying an existing Python SDK application
- Before deploying a Python SDK application

**Usage:**
The agent runs automatically after `/new-sdk-app` creates a Python project, or you can trigger it by asking:
```
"Verify my Python Agent SDK application"
"Check if my SDK app follows best practices"
```

**Output:**
Provides a comprehensive report with:
- Overall status (PASS / PASS WITH WARNINGS / FAIL)
- Critical issues that prevent functionality
- Warnings about suboptimal patterns
- List of passed checks
- Specific recommendations with SDK documentation references

### Agent: `agent-sdk-verifier-ts`

Thoroughly verifies TypeScript Agent SDK applications for correct setup and best practices.

**Verification checks:**
- SDK installation and version
- TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json)
- Correct SDK usage and patterns
- Type safety and imports
- Agent initialization and configuration
- Environment and security (.env, API keys)
- Error handling and functionality
- Documentation completeness

**When to use:**
- After creating a new TypeScript SDK project
- After modifying an existing TypeScript SDK application
- Before deploying a TypeScript SDK application

**Usage:**
The agent runs automatically after `/new-sdk-app` creates a TypeScript project, or you can trigger it by asking:
```
"Verify my TypeScript Agent SDK application"
"Check if my SDK app follows best practices"
```

**Output:**
Provides a comprehensive report with:
- Overall status (PASS / PASS WITH WARNINGS / FAIL)
- Critical issues that prevent functionality
- Warnings about suboptimal patterns
- List of passed checks
- Specific recommendations with SDK documentation references

## Workflow Example

Here's a typical workflow using this plugin:

1. **Create a new project:**
```bash
/new-sdk-app code-reviewer-agent
```

2. **Answer the interactive questions:**
```
Language: TypeScript
Agent type: Coding agent (code review)
Starting point: Basic agent with common features
```

3. **Automatic verification:**
The command automatically runs `agent-sdk-verifier-ts` to ensure everything is correctly set up.

4. **Start developing:**
```bash
# Set your API key
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# Run your agent
npm start
```

5. **Verify after changes:**
```
"Verify my SDK application"
```

## Installation

This plugin is included in the Claude Code repository. To use it:

1. Ensure Claude Code is installed
2. The plugin commands and agents are automatically available

## Best Practices

- **Always use the latest SDK version**: `/new-sdk-app` checks for and installs the latest version
- **Verify before deploying**: Run the verifier agent before deploying to production
- **Keep API keys secure**: Never commit `.env` files or hardcode API keys
- **Follow SDK documentation**: The verifier agents check against official patterns
- **Type check TypeScript projects**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` regularly
- **Test your agents**: Create test cases for your agent's functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Type errors in TypeScript project

**Issue**: TypeScript project has type errors after creation

**Solution**:
- The `/new-sdk-app` command runs type checking automatically
- If errors persist, check that you're using the latest SDK version
- Verify your `tsconfig.json` matches SDK requirements

### Python import errors

**Issue**: Cannot import from `claude_agent_sdk`

**Solution**:
- Ensure you've installed dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Activate your virtual environment if using one
- Check that the SDK is installed: `pip show claude-agent-sdk`

### Verification fails with warnings

**Issue**: Verifier agent reports warnings

**Solution**:
- Review the specific warnings in the report
- Check the SDK documentation references provided
- Warnings don't prevent functionality but indicate areas for improvement
