## 🚀 2-Step Push Process

### STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. Enter:
   - Repository name: **quasars-tools**
   - Description: **Professional Claude Code Plugin Marketplace**
   - Choose: **Public**
   - Uncheck: "Initialize with README"
3. Click: **Create repository**

**You're done with GitHub!** GitHub will show you the next commands to run.

---

### STEP 2: Push Your Code (1-2 minutes)

Copy your GitHub username (e.g., if URL is github.com/varaku, username is "varaku")

Then run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
cd "/mnt/c/Users/rajesh vankayalapati/repos/quasars.tools"

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quasars-tools.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username**

When prompted:
- **Username**: Your GitHub username
- **Password**: Your Personal Access Token (see below)

---

## 🔑 Personal Access Token (3 minutes)

You'll need a Personal Access Token instead of your password:

1. Go to: **https://github.com/settings/tokens**
2. Click: **Generate new token**
3. Enter:
   - Token name: `quasars-tools-push`
   - Expiration: `90 days`
4. Check these boxes:
   - ✓ `repo` (Full control of repositories)
   - ✓ `write:repo_hook` 
   - ✓ `admin:repo_hook`
5. Click: **Generate token**
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)

Use this token as your password when pushing.

## 📝 Example Commands

**If your GitHub username is "varaku":**

```bash
cd "/mnt/c/Users/rajesh vankayalapati/repos/quasars.tools"

git remote add origin https://github.com/varaku/quasars-tools.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

When GitHub asks:
```
Username: varaku
Password: [Paste your Personal Access Token]
```

## 🎓 What if Something Goes Wrong?

See **GITHUB_SETUP.md** for troubleshooting.

Common issues:
- **"Repository already exists"** → Use different name or check GitHub
- **"Authentication failed"** → Token might be wrong, generate new one
- **"fatal: The remote origin already exists"** → Already added, just push
